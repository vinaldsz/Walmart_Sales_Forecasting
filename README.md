## Overview
This project focuses on predicting weekly sales for retail stores using historical sales data. The goal is to provide actionable insights for inventory planning and revenue optimization by leveraging machine learning and data visualization techniques.

## Features
* Predicts weekly sales for multiple stores and departments.
* Achieved R² of 92.6%, indicating the model explains over 92% of the variance in sales.
* Provides insights into sales trends, seasonality, and store performance.
* Visualizes sales patterns through graphs, heatmaps, and pivot tables for better understanding.

## Data Sources
* Historical sales data including Store, Dept, Date, Weekly_Sales.
* Additional store or department features used to enhance model predictions.

## Methodology

### Data Cleaning & Preprocessing
* Handling missing values and outliers.
* Encoding categorical features.

### Feature Engineering
* Derived time-based features such as month, week, and holiday indicators.
* Aggregated store and department metrics to improve model performance.

### Modeling
* Regression models trained to predict weekly sales.
* Performance evaluated using Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R².
* Model explained 92.6% of sales variance.

### Visualization
* Pivot tables to analyze sales by store and department.
* Line plots, bar charts, and scatter plots to show trends and patterns.
* Highlighted stores or departments with unusually high or low sales.

## How to Run

Clone the repository:
`git clone <repo-url>`

Install dependencies:
`pip install -r requirements.txt`

Run the notebook/script to generate predictions and visualizations.

## Insights
* High-performing stores and departments can be identified easily.
* Seasonal trends and sales spikes can be anticipated for inventory planning.
* Model can be retrained with new data to improve accuracy over time.
  
## Technologies Used
* Python (pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, matplotlib, seaborn)
* Jupyter Notebook for analysis and visualization

## Future Work
* Deploy model as an interactive dashboard for dynamic predictions.
* Incorporate external features like promotions, weather, and holidays.
* Use advanced models like XGBoost or neural networks to further improve accuracy.
